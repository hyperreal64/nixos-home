# NixOS Den

This is where [unixcat](https://unixc.at/about) plays with his
[Nix](https://nixos.org) toys, stretches, naps, chews on random Nix-related
things, avoids human interaction, pushes things off surfaces (i.e., breaks a Nix
build) for no apparent reason (maybe it's just in the way, so hiss off!), and
occasionally chases laser pointers that the FOSS community teases him with.
